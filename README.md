# VindictusScamDB
VindictusScamDB is the first database of known scammers on the game vindictus. The script is written with PHP, Html, Javascript, AJAX and MySql.

The code posted here is live on our site and released so others can see some of the work put into VindictusScamDB. Feel free to submit issues or suggestions and I will attempt to fix/implement them.

New in V2.0 RC1:

Changed theme, now uses "Landed" by "HTML5Up" (http://html5up.net/landed)

Removed Class System (not used anymore)

Removed "API.php" (which handled everything system wide)

Added "submit.php" for submitting new scammers via ajax.

Removed "xenforo random posts"

Added function and table to house adsense ads

Changed config, now Database details, Site information, Menu Options, Google info (anaylitics code, reCaptcha keys), and FAQ are stored in Arrays.

Fixed typo in answer to FAQ "What happens if a player I am doing business with is not in the database?"

Added "featherlight Gallery" to table if there are multiple screenshots in the database entry

Added sorting labels to DataTables table

Shoutout to MistyBerry from the VindiDiscord chat for helping resolve a bug with the submit form!
