# VindictusScamDB
VindictusScamDB is the first database of known scammers on the game vindictus. The script is written with PHP, Html, Javascript, AJAX and MySql.

The code posted here is live on our site and released so others can see some of the work put into VindictusScamDB. Feel free to submit issues or suggestions and I will attempt to fix/implement them.

New in V1.7.3:

Replaced old scammer table logic with Datatables

Added logic to support multiple comma seperated screenshot links (uses individual featherlight buttons for each screenshot link, will be replaced with gallery soon)

Fixed bug in "system.class.php" that would cause "under investigation" statstics to return 0 if "submissions" table was empty

Added option to disable xenforo random thread link

Removed Trusted Players section (will be re-added with V2)

Replaced "About Us" with "FAQ" that includes an average NX Pricing table

Added note to index about future Nexon TOS changes

Removed link to Beta v2.0, No longer public until release.
